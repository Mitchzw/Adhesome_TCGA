# Adhesome_TCGA
Jupyter notebook that allows to analyze a subset of genes in TCGA-survival data from doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2018.11.053

Aim of this notebook was to reduce the analysis provided in 10.1016/j.cub.2018.11.053 (https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(22)00313-8) to a subset of genes. In my case, I was interested in the genes forming the consensus adhesome and to see how altered genetic features of them make them useful prognostic markers for survival in different cancer types. 
In short, it turned out that higher gene expression of most adhesome genes is a bad prognostic marker. Maybe I will summarize these findings one day as a review.

Regarding all technical aspects of the code, I believe that the comments in the code should make it quite clear. Please contact me if this is not the case.
